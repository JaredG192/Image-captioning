# 🖼️ Image Captioning AI

This project is a deep learning-based image captioning model developed as part of a machine learning class. It automatically generates descriptive captions for input images using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).

## 📂 Dataset

The full dataset consists of 8,000 images, each paired with 5 human-annotated captions. Due to GitHub storage limitations, the full dataset is hosted externally:
